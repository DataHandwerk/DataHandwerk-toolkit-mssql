. a minimally invasive *repository database* supplements DWH database metadata
** A repository database is externally connected to a DWH database via *synonyms to system catalog views* of the DWH database.
** for additional _minimal invasive interventions_ `extended properties` are used, which can be assigned to many database objects and also columns, parameters etc. and also removed again.
** The DWH database works without the repository and all traces of a repository can be removed (extended properties can be dropped).
. It must *always* be possible for BI developers to use *all* mssql and Azure features in DWH databases.
